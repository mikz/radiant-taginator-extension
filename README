Version: 2.0.beta

This extension enhances the page model with tagging capabilities, tagging as in "2.0" and tagclouds.

== Requirements

This extension depends on the acts-as-taggable-on plugin (included in vendor/plugins)

== Installation

1. Copy the extension to your vendor/extensions directory as you would any other extension.
2. Run 'rake radiant:extensions:tags:install'
3. Make a page to sit in '/t', and give it the "Tag Search" pagetype.
	If you want to change this location, it's in Radiant::Config['tags.results_page_url'].

Done!
Here's a sample results page to get you started;
	
	<r:search:empty>
	  <h2>I couldn't find anything tagged with "<r:search:query/>".</h2>
	</r:search:empty>

	<r:search:results>
	  <h2>Found the following pages that are tagged with "<em><r:search:query/></em>".</h2>

	  <ul>
	  <r:search:results:each>
	    <li><r:link/> - <r:author/> - <r:date/></li>
	  </r:search:results:each>
	  </ul>
	</r:search:results>
